            <p>Sorting algorithms are a method of organizing data in a certain order and can be used to organize messy data to be easier to use. Therefore, developing a strong understanding of sorting algorithms and how they work is a crucial fundamental of computer science.</p>
            <p>Ensuring that lists are organized can be crucial to performing many tasks. For example, removing or merging duplicate entries from large portions of data by sorting the lists based on unique criteria and leaving only the duplicate entries in a group. Another example, sorting two large lists to find out where they differ; by sorting the lists in ascending order, it’s easy to spot the differences in each list.</p>
            <p>Sorting algorithms can help to sort database information, customer data, and financial reports. It’s important to understand how sorting algorithms are beneficial to your business and the right ones to use when performing certain tasks that may require sorting larger portions of data.</p>
             
            <p>Sorting Visualizer is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms. It can be used as a teaching tool in a class or just for personal use</p>
